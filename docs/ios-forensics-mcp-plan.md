# iOS Forensic Analysis MCP Server Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of an MCP (Message Control Protocol) server designed specifically for forensic analysis of iOS device file systems. The server will provide Claude and other AI assistants with access to a local folder containing extracted iOS file system data, enabling comprehensive forensic analysis capabilities.

## Core Architecture

### 1. MCP Server Foundation
- Base the implementation on existing MCP filesystem servers like `mcp-filesystem` and `mcp_server_filesystem`
- Use Python for core functionality with SQLite, plist parsing, and file analysis libraries
- Implement proper sandboxing to ensure only the specified iOS file system directory is accessible

### 2. Connection and Configuration
- Support Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VSCode, and other MCP-compatible clients
- Allow configuration of specific read/write permissions and access controls
- Enable path mapping for iOS filesystem analysis (maintaining original structure)
- Implement logging of all operations for audit trail purposes

## Forensic Analysis Tools Integration

### 1. File System Navigation and Examination
- Directory listing with metadata (timestamps, permissions, file sizes)
- File content extraction with support for various encodings
- File type identification and categorization
- File carving for deleted content recovery
- File hash computation (MD5, SHA1, SHA256) for integrity verification

### 2. SQLite Database Analysis
- SQLite browser for examining iOS databases (.db, .sqlitedb files)
- SQL query executor with forensic-specific functions
- Deleted record recovery from SQLite free pages
- Table structure analysis and relationship mapping
- Database journaling and WAL file analysis

### 3. Property List (Plist) Analysis
- XML and binary plist parsing and extraction
- Plist structure visualization
- Value search and extraction
- Timeline reconstruction from plist timestamps
- Conversion between binary and XML formats for analysis

### 4. iOS-Specific Artifacts Processing
- Messages extraction and analysis (SMS, iMessage)
- Call log and voicemail analysis
- Contact information extraction
- Calendar and reminder data analysis
- Photos database and metadata analysis
- Notes content extraction
- Safari browsing history and bookmark analysis
- Apple Mail data extraction
- System logs and diagnostic information
- Keychain data analysis (if decrypted)
- Health data parsing
- Location data analysis (significant locations, map history)
- App-specific data extraction for common apps

### 5. Advanced Analysis Capabilities
- Timeline generation across multiple data sources
- Pattern recognition for user behavior analysis
- Entity extraction (people, places, organizations)
- Cross-reference searching between different data sources
- Geolocation data visualization
- Statistical analysis of user activities
- Foreign language detection and translation for content

## Implementation Tools

### 1. Core Libraries
- Python 3.9+ as the main programming language
- MCP SDK for Python for protocol implementation
- SQLite3 for database operations
- biplist/plistlib for property list parsing
- xxd or similar for hex viewing/editing
- yara for pattern matching
- pandas for data analysis and correlation

### 2. Forensic-Specific Libraries
- ccl_bplist for binary property list analysis
- python-sqlite-evtx for SQLite forensics
- ios_forensics for iOS-specific artifact parsing
- mac_apt core libraries for advanced artifact parsing
- exif tools for media metadata extraction
- dateutil for comprehensive timestamp handling

## Security Considerations
- Strict path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Read-only mode by default for evidence preservation
- Explicit permission requirements for any write operations
- Input sanitization for all SQL queries
- Detailed logging of all operations for chain of custody
- Support for working with hash-verified copies of data

## Module Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
1. Basic MCP server setup with file system access
2. Directory listing and file reading capabilities
3. File type identification and basic metadata extraction
4. Simple SQLite database browsing
5. Basic plist file parsing

### Phase 2: Forensic Tool Integration
1. SQLite deleted record recovery
2. Advanced plist analysis
3. iOS message and call log extraction
4. Contact and calendar data parsing
5. Browser history and cache analysis

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis Features
1. Cross-file correlation and timeline generation
2. Pattern searching across multiple files
3. Visualization of user activity and location data
4. Entity extraction and relationship mapping
5. Statistical analysis of usage patterns

## Integration with Claude
- Claude will interface with the MCP server to access and analyze files
- Implement specialized prompts for forensic analysis workflows
- Create reporting templates for standardized forensic reports
- Enable interactive analysis with visualization capabilities
- Support for chained operations to build complex forensic workflows

## Testing and Validation
- Use known test datasets (like those from Josh Hickman) for verification
- Compare results with established forensic tools for accuracy
- Perform integrity verification to ensure non-modification of evidence
- Validate timestamp handling across different iOS versions
- Test with partial/corrupted datasets to assess recovery capabilities
